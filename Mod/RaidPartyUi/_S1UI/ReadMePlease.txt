**TERA Online Mod** Created by TechDude01 of the TeraToday forums -- preview.tinyurl.com/terauimod

-Hides the Raid and Party UI completely
-Improves your FPS by hiding these UI elements
-Use 'show health bars' to see health of yourself and other party/raid members if needed (like if you are a healer)

I highly recommend this mod for anyone who is NOT a healer.  It works out awesomely :)

If you installed into Program Files (or Program Files x86) then I recommend you install to another directory that has write access (or edit the security settings manually to allow for full read/write access to the TERA folder).

Please place this folder in the following directory where %TERAINSTALLDIR% is the directory where your main TERA folder is located.  You do NOT need to overwrite any files due to the awesome use of the underscore _ method as revealed on the TeraToday forums.

%TERAINSTALLDIR%\Client\S1Game\CookedPC\Art_Data\Packages
^^Put the entire _S1UI folder in that directory and you are done.

Last note, make sure you EXIT the game and CLOSE the launcher before you do any of this!
